The Degrees of Separation Searcher is a program that takes a .seq input (in NODE-NEIGHBOR form), and returns a histogram of all nodes from all neighbors.
It could be used, for example, to find the average degrees of separation in a large social network. 

This project was completed for the UC Berkeley Course CS61-C, and all modifications made from the skeleton file onwards are proprietary to:

NOTE: The Makefile for this code is machine specific and will not function on most machines. In order to run SmallWorld.java, compile it from source and feed it into hadoop with a properly formatted .seq file.

This Repo's purpose is to demonstrate a good understanding of the Hadoop framework, particularly a grasp of the WRITABLE classes, and the MAPPER and REDUCER utilities.
